# My C++ Project with Modules

This project utilizes C++ modules for improved code organization and dependency management. C++ modules provide a more efficient alternative to traditional header files.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C++ compiler that supports the C++98 standard and includes support for modules. Popular compilers like GCC, and Clang provide experimental support for C++ modules.
